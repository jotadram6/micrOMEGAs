This directory does not present a physical model.
It contains  auxiliary  codes and models which where 
used to prepare micrOMEGAs_2.2. In particular
1) calchep/ directory contains toy models which allow to check 
    a) a model with  basic operators;
    b) a model with twist-2 operator;
    c) a model with WINP-quark-squark  Yukawa interaction
2) work/models contains a toy model which allow to check squark 
co-annihilation. In particular one can see that if Msq-Mlsp <10 GeV then 
co-annihilation ~q,~Q -> G,G puts Relic below WMAP. In its turn it means 
that twist-2 and box diagrams are not so important in direct detection
business.
   main.c and data1.par are tools to play with this toy model. 

3) I1test.c gives a possibility to check a factor which comes from box
diagrams. It demonstrates that  this factor is about [1- 0.5*Mq/(Msq-Mne)].
Compile it by 
        make main=I1test.c
Usage 
       ./I1test Mq Msq Mne
4) Twist2.c - test of Twist2 DD cross sections calculated by loop and 
tree level approachs. Needs two parameters mne and msq.

5) sdGauss.c - calculate table of effective  Gauss radius as a function 
of A^(1/3). 

6) sd_comp.tab.c compare results obtained by Fermi density and against  one 
   obtained with special SD form factors. 
    THIS FUNCTION SHOULD BE MOVED to ../MSSM for compilation.

7) SD_FF_test.c - for visual testing of SD form factors.
8) DD_ALL.c for testing  Direct Detection signals in different experiments.
9) nucleusRecoil.c  calculates number of events for different nuclei.
   Input parameters are Mwimp and proton/neutron SI/SD cross sections.
10) antiprotonNorm.c - compares numerical solution of antiproton propagation 
with analitic formuyla in case of Vc=0 and delta(r) source of DM.
