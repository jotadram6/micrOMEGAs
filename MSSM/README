2.=================== Spectrum Calculation ======================
By default we use SuSpect-2.40 for RGE solution and calculation of particle
spectrum. To use other RGE codes such as  SPHENO or SOFTSUSY the corresponding
variables have to be defined in lib/Makefile. These variables have to contain
the path to the executable program of the corresponding package. 
For example, 
    SOFTSUSY=$HOME/softsusy 
    SPHENO=$HOME/SPheno3.0.beta50/bin
We use the SLHA file interface to pass data from the RGE code to micrOMEGAs.
We also support an interface with ISAJET despite the fact that ISAJET does not 
have a complete SLHA interface. To this end one has to define the paths to the
Isajet and CERNlib libraries via the ISAJET and CERNLIB  variables 
in   lib/Makefile.  After that  
       make -C lib isajet_slha 
will generate the lib/isajet_slha  file needed for the micrOMEGAs/ISAJET
interface. For Isajet versions before 7.79 add the flag -Dlt779 to $(FC) compiler. 
Often computers contain two different Fortran compilers f77(g77)
and gfortran which are not compatible. Please check that
CERNlib/Isajet/micrOMEGAs are compiled with the same compiler.

3.  main.c/main.F are  standard main programs for micrOMEGAs and contain 
all options of micrOMEGAs. Note that these options can be switched 
ON/OFF by defining the variables near the top of the main file:

#define MASSES_INFO      
#define CONSTRAINTS     
#define OMEGA            
#define INDIRECT_DETECTION  
/*#define RESET_FORMFACTORS*/
#define CDM_NUCLEON 
/* #define TEST_Direct_Detection */
/*#define CDM_NUCLEUS */
/*#define DECAYS */
/* #define CROSS_SECTIONS */
/* #define SHOWPLOTS */
The names of variables should be self-explanatory.
    
The name of the RGE package is defined by the variable 'RGE'
possible values of this variable are 'suspect','isajet','softSusy','spheno'.
See item 2 above.

The MSSM scenario is also specified  by 'define', possible scenarios are SUGRA, AMSB, or EWSB.
If none of these are defined the program will read the MSSM parameters from an 
SLHA file  whose name should be passed to the program as a parameter.
In general, if you launch  ./main without parameters the program 
writes on the screen  which parameters are expected. 
 
4. Example files 
    a) cycle2.c and cycle5.c  are test programs which should reproduce 
       Table_2 and Table_5 in Comput.Phys.Commun.180:747-767,2009.
       (arXiv:0803.2360). 
    b) mssm1.par is a file with EWSB parameters which is called from cycle2.c.
       It also can by used  with main.c/main.F.
       mssm2.par is another sample input file for EWSB parameters.
    c)  model1.slha and  model2.slha are SLHA input files used in
      arXiv:1004.1092. See section "Examples and results", Table4, Figures
     3,5,6.  To use such input file (SLHA) the user has to 
     comment all RGE definition in main.c(F)
/* #define SUGRA */
/* #define AMSB  */
/* #define EWSB  */
     recompile the program 
                 make main=main.c 
     and launch it with   
                 ./main model2.slha 


5. The directory nngg contains the code for calculating the loop-induced cross sections
  ~o1,~o1 -> A,Z and ~o1,~o1->A,A 
This code is rather cumbersome. So, it is not compiled by default. 
If you need such cross sections  launch 'make' inside this directory.
or 
              make -C nngg
After compilation the corresponding cross section can be obtained by 
the 'loopGamma' function call written in main.c(F).
