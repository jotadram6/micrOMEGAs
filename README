!   We use 'gmake' options in our Makefiles. If you do not have 'gmake' 
!   then more likely your  'make'  is identical to 'gmake'.


I. General  installation.
   Launch
       [g]make 

   It should generate files with compilers flags
       CalcHEP_src/FlagsForMake
       CalcHEP_src/FlagsForSh
   
   and  compile  
       CalcHEP_src/bin/s_calchep 
       sources/micromegas.a

   Possible problems are discussed in Section VII below. 

   micromegas_2.4 was tested for  Linux, OSF1, SunOS, Darwin, 
   Cygwin.
 
II. To work with MSSM, NMSSM, CPVMSSM, LHM, RHNM  models
    go to the corresponding directory. 

    To generate an executable use
     [g]make main=<source file>
                                                          
    <source file> is expected to be a C  (.c) file, C++ (.cpp) one,
     or a Fortran (.F) file.

    The list of functions you can use in  your programs is described in 
    hep-ph/0405253, hep-ph/0607059, arXiv:0803.2360[hep-ph] and arXiv:1005.4133[hep-ph].

 *** For Cygwin, launch an executable with 
    ../cgwRun <exe with parameters>

III. Each model directory  contains at least 2 sample  files: 
      main.c 
      main.F
      a sample for C++  can be obtained by 'cp main.c main.cpp'
 
     main.c and main.F  contain  several independent modules 
     which can be switched ON  by '#define' preprocessor instructions
     at the top of the file.

     The modules are:

   a) MASSES_INFO
       displays mass spectrum for odd particles (super partners) and 
       Higgs particles;
   b) CONSTRAINTS
       checks experimental  constraints;  
   c) OMEGA
       computes the relic density;
   d) INDIRECT_DETECTION
       calculates  WIMP annihilation spectra and integrate
       over halo profile;
   e) RESET_FORMFACTORS
       resets parameters of nucleon form factors, DM velocity 
       distribution, and nucleus Fermi density;
   f) WIMP_NUCLEON
       calculates WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering amplitudes
   g) WIMP_NUCLEUS
       calculates the number of events for 1day&1kg  of detector material and 
       recoil energy distribution for WINP-nuclei reaction;
   h) CROSS_SECTIONS
       calculates different  widths and cross sections

IV. Each model directory contains a subdirectory  'calchep/' intended 
    for calculation of different cross sections and decay widths 
    in  interactive sessions  for SM and other models.  
        
V.To implement a new model, launch 
    ./newProject  <project name>
      
 Then the directory <project name> will be created with all needed subdirectories 
 and  sample  files inside. Further instructions can be found in the local 
 README file. 
      
VI. To clean all generated files use 
   [g]make clean 
      or  
   ./clean 
   launched from micromegas_2.4 directory. In each model directory you 
   can call 
     [g]make clean 
   to remove all generated files in this particular directory.

VII. Compilers and  their Flags
    Options for compilation are stored in the file 
       CalcHEP/FlagsForSh   
    If this files does not exist, it is generated by [g]make according 
    to Unix version. If CalcHEP/FlagsForSh exists, [g]make
    only checks it.  In case of problem with compilers and their flags 
    one can improve CalcHEP/FlagsForSh and launch [g]make again.
    Using 
         [g]make clean 
    you will be asked about an option to save FlagsForSh for the next
    compilation.  
        [g]make flags
    only generates FlagsForSh file. It gives you an option to 
    select the compiler and flags you prefer.
